How does $\\phi$ affect the universe?\n* probability amplitude\n* does $\\phi$ set the curvature perturbations $\\zeta$? or does the realization do that? e.g., consider a uniform distribution: do we expect fluctuations?\n\nHow does $n_s$ constrain inflation? What does $n_s = 1$ mean?\n\n“Gut-level” explanation of what’s going on\n* Why PCA + Fisher and not another technique?\n* Explain to an experimentalist\n\nAt high $\\ell$s, foregrounds going to kill you\n* how do _Planck_, SO, CMB-S4 deal with this?\n\nHow to ask the right questions? (right = scientifically relevant)"
