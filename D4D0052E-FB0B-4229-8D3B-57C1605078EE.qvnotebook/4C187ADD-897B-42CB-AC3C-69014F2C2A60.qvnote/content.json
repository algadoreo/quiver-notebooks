Systematics, right?\n\n* What are the axes?\n* Highlight key points in the equations using English words\n\nWhat is Cosmosis? How you are using MCMC in this?\n\nHow do the supernova data constrain the LCDM params?\n\nYou had a good explanation of the Fisher matrix, can you put that in a picture? The equation you have is hard to understand.\n\n* Fisher requires an input data point, where did you get that from?\n* What happens if you change the central point?\n\nBananas: why do they arise?\n\nDerivative Approximation of Likelihood (DALI): how long do you think it would take?"

Are they different from the usual CMB maps?\nHow do you make a lensing map?\n\nYou explain what stacking does, but why does it work?\n\nStep 3, what is the relation between the two plots shown?\n\nHow did you decide which modes to filter out?"
