Do I need to re-show their method? This would be in method, I think\n\n### Fisher analysis\n\n* Why it’s useful\n* Could re-use a lot of stuff from proposal\n\n### PCA\n\n* How it works:\n  * Show the linear algebra\n  * From correlated to uncorrelated parameters"

Have to explain why they’re not exactly the same though – may be because of systematics: Fisher analysis only tells you _statistical errors_, not systematic ones."
