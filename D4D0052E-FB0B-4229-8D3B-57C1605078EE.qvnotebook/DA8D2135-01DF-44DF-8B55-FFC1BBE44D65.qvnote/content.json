      "data": "The **primordial power spectrum** describes curvature (“adiabatic”) perturbations laid down by inflation, which has scalar and tensor components. Scalar perturbations describe the field of density fluctuations, whereas tensor perturbations describe spacetime (metric) fluctuations.\n\nBecause the equations for tensor fluctuations can be derived with minimal changes to the scalar fluctuations, it suffices for our purposes to show the latter.\n\n## Primordial scalar density perturbations\nThe primordial power spectrum of scalar density fluctuations is typically parameterized as the power law\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{P}(k) = A_s \\left( \\frac{k}{k_0} \\right)^{n_s - 1}\n\\end{align} with amplitude $A_s$, “tilt” $n_s$, and the “pivot scale” $k_0$ (at which $P(k_0) = A_s$).\n\nBut where does this come from? The story begins with the curvature perturbation $\\zeta$ set down by quantum effects during inflation.\n\nAs with most quantities in cosmology, it is useful to consider the spectrum of the curvature perturbations $\\zeta(k)$. Note that the expansion of the universe means that a perturbation of size $k$ will also grow in physical size. Because the expansion is superluminal during inflation, many of these modes (i.e., a perturbation of a certain size) will exit the Hubble horizon. It can be proved that these perturbations freeze as they cross the horizon and become **superhorizon**,\n\\begin{align}\n\\lim_{k \\ll aH} \\dot{\\zeta_\\mathbf{k}} = 0.\n\\end{align} This is an important point because inflation and the CMB (and beyond) are directly connected via this mechanism.\n\n**N.B.:** In natural units, the comoving Hubble horizon is $k = aH$.\n\nMathematically, the freezing of these perturbations at horizon crossing also has profound implications. Without getting into too much detail, it can be shown that the power spectrum of $\\zeta$ at horizon crossing follows\n\\begin{align}\nP_\\zeta(k) = \\left. \\frac{1}{4k^3} \\frac{H^2}{\\varepsilon} \\right|_{k=aH} ,\n\\end{align} or, in dimensionless form,\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta_s^2 (k) = \\frac{k^3}{2\\pi^2} P_\\zeta(k) = \\left. \\frac{1}{8\\pi^2} \\frac{H^2}{\\varepsilon} \\right|_{k=aH}.\n\\end{align} Here, $\\varepsilon$ is the first **slow-roll parameter**.\n\nBy convention, we define the scalar spectral index $n_s$ as\n\\begin{align}\nn_s - 1 = \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\ln \\Delta_s^2}{\\mathrm{d} \\ln k}.\n\\end{align} If $n_s$ is constant, then we can integrate this to obtain\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{P}(k) = A_s \\left( \\frac{k}{k_0} \\right)^{n_s - 1}.\n\\end{align}\n\nA perfectly **scale-invariant spectrum**, also known as the **Harrison–Zel’dovich–Peebles spectrum**, is one where $n_s \\equiv 1$. This has been ruled out by observations, notably, by the fact that inflation cannot end when $n_s \\equiv 1$.\n\nIn the case where $n_s$ varies with $k$, the quantity $n_s'(k)$ is known as the “running” of the spectrum."

      "data": "## The matter power spectrum\n\nThe curvature perturbation $P_\\zeta$ itself cannot be directly measured. But because GR says that spacetime curvature and energy–matter density go hand-in-hand, we could measure at the latter instead. In this case, the relevant quantity is the Newtonian potential $\\Phi$, and as a consequence of GR, $P_\\Phi \\propto P_\\zeta$.\n\nFrom perturbation theory, the potential at late times is given by Poisson’s equation\n\\begin{align}\n\\nabla^2 \\Phi = -4\\pi G \\bar{\\rho}_\\text{m} a^2 \\delta \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad k^2 \\Phi_k = 4\\pi G \\bar{\\rho}_\\text{m} a^2 \\delta_k.\n\\end{align} Since $\\bar{\\rho}_\\text{m} = \\Omega_\\text{m} \\rho_\\text{cr}/a^3$ (by definition) and $4\\pi G \\rho_\\text{cr} = (3/2) H_0^2$ (from the Friedmann equations),\n\\begin{align}\n\\delta(\\mathbf{k},a) = \\frac{k^2 \\Phi(\\mathbf{k},a) \\,a}{(3/2)\\Omega_\\text{m} H_0^2}.\n\\end{align}\n\nSchematically, the potential at a given scale factor $a(t)$ can be obtained from the primordial potential via\n\\begin{align}\n\\Phi(\\mathbf{k},a) &= \\Phi_\\text{p}(\\mathbf{k}) \\times \\text{Transfer function}(k) \\times \\text{Growth function}(a) \\\\\n&= \\frac{9}{10} \\Phi_\\text{p}(\\mathbf{k}) \\,T(k) \\frac{D_1(a)}{a} \\; \\text{by convention}.\n\\end{align}\n\nThe density perturbation is then\n\\begin{align}\n\\delta(\\mathbf{k},a) = \\frac{3}{5} \\frac{k^2}{\\Omega_\\text{m} H_0^2} \\Phi_\\text{p}(\\mathbf{k}) \\,T(k) \\,D_1(a),\n\\end{align} and its power spectrum can be seen (by squaring both sides) to take the form\n\\begin{align}\nP_\\delta(k) \\propto k^4 P_\\Phi(k) \\,T^2(k).\n\\end{align}\n\nFrom the Boltzmann fluid equations, it can be shown that\n\\begin{align}\nT(k) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{radiation-dominated era},\\\\\n(k_\\text{eq}/k)^2 & \\text{matter-dominated era},\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{align} where $k_\\text{eq}$ is the scale that _re-entered_ the horizon at matter–radiation equality.\n\nFinally, because $P_\\Phi \\propto P_\\zeta \\propto k^{n_s - 1}$, we can say that the power spectrum of matter density perturbations is\n\\begin{align}\nP(k) \\propto\n\\begin{cases}\nk^{n_s} & \\text{radiation-dominated era},\\\\\nk^{n_s-4} & \\text{matter-dominated era}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{align} Inserting $n_s \\approx 1$ will produce a plot of the matter power spectrum that is well matched by observations."
