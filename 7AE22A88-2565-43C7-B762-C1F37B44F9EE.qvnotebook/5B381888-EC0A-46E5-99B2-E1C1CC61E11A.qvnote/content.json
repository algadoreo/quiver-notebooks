      "data": "## How to describe polarization?\n\nStokes parameters:\n* $I$: total intensity\n* $Q$: linear polarization (N–S, E–W)\n* $U$: linear polarization (45°: NE–SW, NW–SE)\n* $V$: circular polarization\n\nThomson scattering does not produce circular polarization, so no $V$.\n\nNotice that a sign flip in temperature (hot $\\leftrightarrow$ cold) means a flip in sign. What this creates is a **spin-2 field**: $Q$ and $U$ rotate into one another in a rotation\n\\begin{align}\n\\begin{pmatrix}Q'\\\\U'\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\\cos 2\\psi & \\sin 2\\psi \\\\ -\\sin 2\\psi & \\cos 2\\psi\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}Q\\\\U\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align} (the 2 reflects the spin-2 nature). _[Draw example on board]_\n\nBy contrast, temperature is **spin-0** because it is invariant under rotations. This gives it two advantages:\n* coordinate system-independent\n  * don’t have to worry about every experiment having different coordinates\n* easier math\n\n**WE WANT TO WORK WITH SPIN-0 FIELDS!** How do we get it?\n\nStart with the spherical harmonic expansions:\n\\begin{align}\nT(\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}) &= \\sum_{\\ell m} a_{\\ell m}^\\text{T} Y_\\ell^m (\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}) \\\\\n(Q \\pm iU)(\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}) &= \\sum_{\\ell m} a_{\\pm 2,\\ell m} \\,{}_{\\pm 2}Y_\\ell^m(\\mathbf{\\hat{n}})\n\\end{align}\n\nDefine\n\\begin{align}\na_{\\ell,m}^\\text{E} &= -\\frac{1}{2}(a_{2,\\ell m} + a_{-2,\\ell m}) \\\\\na_{\\ell,m}^\\text{B} &= -\\frac{1}{2i}(a_{2,\\ell m} - a_{-2,\\ell m})\n\\end{align} combining spin $+2$ and $-2$ quantities gives spin 0. We get new spin-0 fields:\n\\begin{align}\nE(\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}) &= \\sum_{\\ell m} a_{\\ell m}^\\text{E} Y_\\ell^m (\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}) \\\\\nB(\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}) &= \\sum_{\\ell m} a_{\\ell m}^\\text{B} Y_\\ell^m (\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}). \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\nReason why they are called $E$ and $B$ are in analogy with EM:\n* $\\nabla \\times E = 0$ and $\\nabla \\cdot B = 0$\n* Also reason why they are called grad ($E = \\nabla \\phi$) and curl ($B = \\nabla \\times A$) fields\n\nI think the most natural way to understand them is their parity. It turns out that\n* $E$ has EVEN parity (same after LR flipping)\n* $B$ has ODD parity (rotated 180° after flipping)\n\nReason why parity is important is because **different polarization sources produce patterns that differ in parity**."

      "data": "## Sources of polarization\n\nBecause polarization is spin-2, it is described by a rank-2 tensor, which has the unique property that it can be decomposed into SVT components (can’t do this for other ranks). \n\nThings that can create a temperature quadrupole:\n\n**Scalar:** density perturbations\n\n**Vector:** vorticity in cosmological fluid\n\n**Tensor:** gravitational waves\n\n_[show the patterns]_\n\nSo by looking at the ratios of E and B-modes produced, we can learn about these sources in the early universe.\n* $E \\gg B$: scalars dominant\n* ~~$E \\ll B$: vectors dominant~~\n* $E \\sim B$: tensors dominant\n\nAs it turns out, vectors get damped out by the expanding universe, so they are negligible.\n\nOkay, so we now know how it works, let’s do some science with it!"

      "data": "## Uses of polarization\n\nAs I alluded to at the beginning, the temperature spectrum is prone to late-time effects. In particular, the amplitude of the TT spectrum is damped by reionization:\n\\begin{align}\nC_\\ell^{TT} \\sim \\Delta T^2 \\sim A_s e^{-2\\tau}\n\\end{align} i.e., we don’t know if the power was originally low or whether it was damped out. **If we can find out the optical depth of the universe, we break this degeneracy.**\n\nThis is where E-modes come in. It turns out reionization itself generates new polarization because there’s now a whole bunch of free electrons floating around. But because reionization happened so late (500 Myr after BB), the new polarization is generated at angular scales of $\\ell < 10$ (horizon at last scattering is $\\ell \\sim 180$).\n\n_[show reionization bump]_\n\nEarlier reionization means wider and taller peak:\n* $n_e$ was larger (scales as $a^{-3}$)\n* reaches smaller angular scales (larger $\\ell$)\n\nAnd $n_e$ increases $\\Rightarrow \\tau$ increases because $\\tau = \\int n_e \\sigma_T \\,\\mathrm{d}s$."
