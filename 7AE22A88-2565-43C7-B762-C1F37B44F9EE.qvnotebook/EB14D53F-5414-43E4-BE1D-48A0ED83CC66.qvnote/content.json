The issue with this argument is that it doesn’t account for the things that leave the horizon early on and re-enter some time after inflation ceases – i.e., _what does the evolution look like outside the horizon?_\n\nCan do a careful treatment, but can also hand-wave it away by saying that perturbations outside the horizon are immune to causal effects. _But things just outside the horizon are still within causal influence of the horizon itself, right???_\n\n**N.B.:** scale-invariance holds only if expansion is exponential.
